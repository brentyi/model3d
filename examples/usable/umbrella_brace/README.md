# umbrella_brace

This is a printable umbrella hole ring for tightening an outdoor umbrella into a base or table. In particular, I needed this print to get an [AMMSUN Patio Umbrella](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082SHSM5X?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) to lock tightly into a [DC America Umbrella Base](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0025VP5J8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details).
