# box

This is a four-part box. It includes a screw, a handle, a lid, and a body. It is 1 inch deep, 4 inches long, and 3 inches wide by default, but these dimensions can be adjusted in the constants at the top of the file. The handle screws onto the lid, and the lid fits snugly in the box.

All parts are designed to be printed on a commodity FDM printer.

The file heart.png controls the shape of the handle and the engraving on it. Shape is in red, and engraving is in black. Background is fully transparent.
