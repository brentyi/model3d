# watch_holder

This example makes use of the `toolbox3d.RectSet` API to quickly create a 3D model that is comprised of 3D rectangular volumes. Many useful objects can be defined in such a way, and the API makes it easy to create meshes from these definitions. In this case, we create a "cradle" that you can 3D print and mount on a wall or a piece of furniture to hold a smartwatch while it charges. It includes a small slit for a charger to reach in and go under the watch.
