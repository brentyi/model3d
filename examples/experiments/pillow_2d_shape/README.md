# pillow-2d-shape

This is a work-in-progress experiment to try and generate rounded 3D shapes from 2D shapes.

This rounding algorithm is inspired by the fact that 2D shapes have natural extensions into 3D. For example, a circle naturally becomes a sphere, a square becomes a pillow-like shape, a heart becomes a rounded and smooth heart-like object, etc.
