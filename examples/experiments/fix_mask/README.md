# fix-mask

This little program modifies an open-source face mask STL file to be easier to print with Cura on an FDM printer. In particular, it orients the model flatly, removes the need for support in the strap holes, and prints a tighter cover for the filter.

See the top of [main.go](main.go) for details.
