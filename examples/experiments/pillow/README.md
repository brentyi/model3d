# pillow

These experiments try to address the question "how do we turn a 2D shape into a rounded, smooth, 3D model". The constraints are:

  1. Circles turn into spheres
  2. Smooth 2D shapes turn into smooth 3D shapes

I find [pillow_medial](pillow_medial) to be the most compelling, as it creates the best 3D heart shape.
