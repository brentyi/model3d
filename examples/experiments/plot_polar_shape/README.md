# plot_polar_shape

Some images (e.g. cartoon hearts) are naturally defined in polar coordinates, yet it may be hard to visualize what the radius function looks like when they are plotted. This tool helps "unwind" a polar function and plots it into an xy-graph, where the x axis is theta and the y axis is radius.
