# corgi

This example shows how to combine a bunch of rough geometric parts into a smooth result. In particular, [smooth_join.go](smooth_join.go) uses signed distance functions combined with the dynamic smoothing API to smooth a mesh more closer to intersections of different parts of the model.

This example also colors its resulting mesh by defining a set of volumes in which various colors are used.
