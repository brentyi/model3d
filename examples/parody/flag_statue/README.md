# flag-statue

This is a parody of the statue [Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima). My parents were holding on to a replica of this statue for a while, and my mom wanted it out. Once they finally got rid of it, I printed a small parody of the statue as a joke.
