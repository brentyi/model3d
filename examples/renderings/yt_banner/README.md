# yt_banner

This is a banner for a YouTube channel. The text is stored in [assets/letters.png](assets/letters.png) and can be easily changed. The floor texture is also in the `assets/` directory, and was from [rawpixel.com](https://www.rawpixel.com/image/2035862/pink-marble-slate). The corgi model was generated by the example in `examples/decoration/corgi`; it was split into different meshes per each color, and then stored in a single zip file.

The current output looks like so:
