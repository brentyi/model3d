# model3d

This is a collection of tools for programmatically creating and manipulating 3D models, with some focus on 3D printing.

# Examples

The [examples](examples) directory has a lot of examples for how to use this library. Most of these examples produce models which can be 3D printed. Lots of these examples include renderings of the models, produced by my ray casting API.
